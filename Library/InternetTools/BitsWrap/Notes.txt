The content of the BitsWrap directory is a manual port I did from the VB.NET wrapper
wrote by Duncan Mackenzie (MS) around the BITS COM interfaces.
The original work 
"Using Windows XP Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) with Visual Studio .NET"
could be found at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnwxp/html/WinXP_BITS.asp
The port is not 100% complete but close.
The library was provided AS IS without significant restrictions for using in commercial
applications.

The main difference is that Mackenzie's work was based on BITS 1.5 which didn't comprise
proxies support, so I extended it; for the P/Invoke stuff, I replaced the original work with
the equivalent downloaded from the C# version of "Updater Application Block"

provided by MS as part of the Enterprise Library; the Enterprise Library licence would want
an explicit mention in the about box, but I didn't actually use the Enterprise library nor any
code line from its business logic, I just took the COM interfaces which are build using an automated tool.
